# bike-sharing-analysis
This study aimed to forecast the demand for bike sharing services in the metropolitan city of Seoul using the Seoul bike sharing dataset. To do this, a variety of machine learning models were used to forecast demand for bike sharing, including regression analysis (linear, lasso, ridge, elastic net, and polynomial), k-nearest neighbors, random forest, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, catboost, and light gradient boosting machine. The accuracy and efficiency of each model were assessed using a number of measures, such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and mean absolute error. The dataset includes hourly demand data for bike-sharing services over a two-year period from 2017 to 2018, along with weather information and other relevant features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.
In order to find patterns and get relevant insights from the data, this study also used factorial analysis and clustering techniques like k-means and fuzzy c-means. The outcomes of these methods were put to use in order to comprehend the fundamental causes of Seoul's demand for bike sharing programs.
The outcomes of this study can aid in the decision-making process for legislators, transportation planners, and bike sharing service providers. These stakeholders can strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of bike sharing programs, which will ultimately lead to higher utilization and improved accessibility for users, by accurately estimating the demand for bike sharing services.

The experimental finding demonstrates: 
A heat map demonstrates a strong correlation between temperature and dew point. When there is a working day, the bike is hired otherwise, it is not. The most bikes are leased between the hours of 17 and 19, as well as early in the morning at 8pm in 2018. Most bikes are hired on the sixth and ninth of each month. Summer saw the highest number of bike rentals, followed by autumn, spring, and winter. Except in a few cases, people have reserved more bikes when it hasn't rained as much. The busiest months for renting bikes are May through July, and December through February are the least popular months. Workdays rather than holidays are when the majority of bicycles are rented. After testing a number of models, it was determined that the lightGBM and Catboost model was the most effective for predicting demand for bike sharing because its performance metrics (mse, rmse) were lower and its adjusted_r2 value was higher. For the bike rental stations, we can utilize either the lightGBM or catboost models.

The predictive model created for this research has significant effects on bike-sharing programs, especially in terms of increasing the accessibility and availability of rental bikes. The predictive model can assist bike-sharing systems manage their operations and resource allocation by predicting the hourly demand for rental bikes. Overall, the predictive model has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of bike-sharing programs, making them easier to use, more effective, and more accessible.

Some potential future directions for this research include exploring the use of machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, to improve the accuracy of the predictive models. Additionally, research could be done to examine the transferability of the models to other cities and to other types of transportation systems.
